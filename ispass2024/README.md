## Abstract

As computing systems become increasingly complex, simulation has taken on a pervasive role in the process of designing and analyzing proposed systems.
Often, simulation is the foremost method of understanding the intricacies of novel high-performance architectures, emerging technologies, and interconnect topologies; it is used for gathering crucial information about software performance, energy consumption, and network eï¬€iciency.
In parallel with the increased use of simulations, there has been growth in the number of available models for specific applications, fomenting a growing urgency for interoperability, consistency, and communication between simulation tools and their developers.
To ease the use and interoperability of larger simulated systems, a standard communication methodology between models is needed.

We will introduce attendees to the Structural Simulation Toolkit, SST, as a framework for building interoperable simulators capable of modeling modern computer systems.

This tutorial will include an introduction to the core concepts in SST, after which we will look at the many architectural simulation components available in SST-Elements. We will then cover two in-depth examples: single-node, multi-core simulation using memHierarchy, and network simulation using Ember, Firefly, and Merlin.
